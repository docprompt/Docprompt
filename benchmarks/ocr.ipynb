    "## OCR Notebook\n",
    "Optical Character Recognition (OCR), is one of the most crucial tasks in document processing. The primary goal is to extract text and layout information in the form of bounding boxes. There are several popular service providers for OCR, including open source libraries, for more custom/private solutions. In this notebook, we will cover:\n",
    "- OCR with AWS Textract\n",
    "- OCR with GCP Document AI\n",
    "- OCR with Tesseract (Open-Source)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to demonstrating how to execute OCR processing jobs with DocPrompt, this notebook will also explore the powerful `DocumentProvenanceLocator`, a Rust implemented search tool which is powered by the OCR results."
